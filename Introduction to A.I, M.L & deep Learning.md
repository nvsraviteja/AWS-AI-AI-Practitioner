# What is AI?
It is a computer or a machine that has the ability to perform task that require human intelligence like reasoning , problem solving, decision making etc. 

It is also a simulation of human intelagince in machine that are programed to think, reason, and make decisions. 

AI enables machines to perform task that requires human intelligence such as:

1. **Learning**
2. **Reasoning**
3. **Problem-solving**
4. **Perception** (ability to understand something by sensing it like vision, sound, recognition etc.)


AI is broadly categorized into:
- **Narrow AI**: AI systems designed for specific tasks (e.g., virtual assistants, recommendation systems).
- **General AI**: Hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can do.
- **Superintelligent AI**: A future concept where AI surpasses human intelligence.

AI technologies include machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, robotics, and more.

## Applications of AI 
AI applications span various domains: healthcare, finance, transportation, entertainment, and more. 

## Examples of AI:
- Chatbots
- Autonomous vehicles
- Personalized recommendations
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis.

## History of AI: 
* 1950s - Birth of AI research
    *  Alan Turing's "Turing Test."
    * John McCarthy
* 1960s - Early AI milestones
   * Introduction of ELIZA chatbot.
* 1970s - Expert systems emerged.
  * MYCIN medical expert system to detect bacterial infections.
* 1980s - Neural networks gained popularity.
* 1990s - Machine learning algorithms advanced and Data mining techniques developed.
* 1997 - IBM's Deep Blue beats chess champion Garry Kasparov.
* 2010s - Deep learning revolution.
    * AlphaGo defeats Go world champions.
* 2020s - Virtual assistant, autonomous vehicles, health care diagnostics etc.
* Present Day - AI integrated into daily life.

# What is Neural Network?
It is inspired by human brain because of its functionality and structure. it is made up of layers connected neurons which process information. It learns from data and improves over time.
Each neuron combines the weighted input and applies an activation function for non-linearity and produces output.

- Non Linearity: by this the modal can learn more complex patterns or data and represents the relationship between inputs and outputs. Eg: Curves, intersections, etc.
- Linearity: the modal can learn only simple patterns like straight lines

# Structure of Neural Network
1. Input layer: takes raw features from the dataset.
2. Hidden layer: this process one or more layers of input data. These layers learns how to represent the complex data by combining the inputs in various ways. 
3. Output layer: it process the final result based on the hidden layer.

## Mathematical representation of neural network
* Output = (weights * input + bias) * activation
  * weights x inputs - each input has a weight and multiplied with their respective weights.
  * bias - A bias value is added to adjust the position of line.
  * Activation - it goes through an activation process (function), which decides the final output and adds non-linearity to the model.

Example:
  * Inputs x1 = 2, x2 = 3
  * Weights w1 = 0.5, w2 = 0.8
  * Bias b = 0.3
  * Output y = (w1*x1 + w2*x2 + b)
        * y = (0.5*2 + 0.8*3 + 0.3)
        * y = (1+2.4+0.3)
        * y = 3.7
